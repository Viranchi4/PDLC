Product idea: E-Commerce Website

An ecommerce website is a website that enables you to buy and sell products over the internet. 
E-commerce started in 1960s when organizations began using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to transfer documents of their business back and forth. The 1990s saw the emergence of the online shopping businesses which is an important part of our lives today. The first-ever online purchase was the Sting CD, sold by US retailer, NetMarket on 11 August 1994. 
It has become so convenient and easy, that anyone can shop anything anytime right from the living room with just a few clicks. This has evolved more with the emergence of smartphones which enables you to shop from anywhere anytime making use of wireless device connected to the internet. It enables you to search any product or services online without having to physically go anywhere.
