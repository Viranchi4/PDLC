## Product idea: Ecommerce Website

An ecommerce website is a website that enables you to buy and sell products over the internet. 

E-commerce started in 1960s when organizations began using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to transfer documents of their business back and forth. The 1990s saw the emergence of the online shopping businesses which is an important part of our lives today. The first-ever online purchase was the Sting CD, sold by US retailer, NetMarket on 11 August 1994. 

It has become so convenient and easy, that anyone can shop anything anytime right from the living room with just a few clicks. This has evolved more with the emergence of smartphones which enables you to shop from anywhere anytime making use of wireless device connected to the internet. It enables you to search any product or services online without having to physically go anywhere. 

### There are different types of ecommerce websites:

- Business-to-business (B2B): Electronic transactions of goods and services between companies. For example, a business sells SAP products to other business.
- Business-to-Consumer (B2C): Electronic transactions of goods and services between companies and consumers. For example, when you buy shoes from an online store.
- Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): Electronic transactions of goods and services between consumers, mostly through a third party. For example, you sell your old laptop on eBay or olx to another consumer.
- Consumer-to-Business (C2B): Electronic transactions of goods and services where individuals offer products or services to companies. For example, a social media influencer offers exposure to their online audience in exchange for a fee.

### How does E-commerce work?

E-commerce is not very different from the physical retail industry. The only difference it has with the brick and mortar store is that here, the entire process takes place over the internet. 

The journey of an ecommerce firms begins with setting up an ecommerce website. After that, the products are displayed along with necessary details like product descriptions and price tags. A button like “Buy Now” is placed near the products for the convenience of the customers. If they feel like buying the product they can simple click on the button and make the payment. Customers are usually asked to fill the form while placing their orders. They need to provide the necessary details like the delivery address.

There is different payment methods used in the E-Commerce industry. Buyers can either make payment using a payment gateway or they can use credit or debit cards or internet banking. There is another option like COD or cash on delivery. In this option the buyer makes the payment when the item they ordered is delivered on their personal address. The payment can be made either in cash or through cards or other convenient options like Google Pay.

If the consumer is not satisfied with the quality of the product or by mistake a different product gets delivered, they can use the reverse logistics system. It is simply returning the item and getting the money back. The consumer needs to notify that they want to return the product. A representation of the company will contact the consumer and take the product. The money will be returned to the account. 

The product promotion in E-Commerce is also done digitally. The two most promising methods are digital advertising and email marketing. Ads are placed on the social media platforms which are most preferred by the target groups. All visitors are asked to provide their email address. Based on the email list is prepared. After that personal emails are sent. Sometimes personal notifications are also sent to the social media accounts of the prospect costumers.

### 4W’s and 1H:

#### Who:

The target customers are the direct consumers who will make use of the platform to buy products online. A consumer can view the product on the platform and can choose among it and order the same. The website will then send the notification to the business organization and the organization will dispatch the product to the consumer.

#### What:

The problem at hand is that whenever a consumer needs to buy a product they need to travel physically to the store and purchase it. This traditional process consumes a lot of time and effort which can be utilized to other important tasks otherwise. To tackle this issue an ecommerce website can be used which enables the consumer to purchase any product from any place by just few clicks on their digital device. 

#### When:

The history of the ecommerce can be traced back to 1960s with the development of the Electronic Data Interchange. Not long after that in 1979 the concept of teleshopping was invented by English inventor Michel Aldrich. Finally in 1990, when the World Wide Web came into existence, the new servers and websites were started being built. In 1994 online books and CDs shopping started in US and soon many products and online shopping services came into existence. 

A website can be built in time of 2 months but planning the business and taking care of the investment and other important issues can take around 3 months. So after around 6 months in total the website can be launched with proper planning.

#### Where:

The ecommerce website is an online platform. It can be used from anywhere but it depends whether the services is provided at the consumer’s location. For example, there can be a local ecommerce website that provides services limited to a city or few cities. In that case the consumers in that city can use the website. Starting a new ecommerce business should be small scale so starting with my own city (Ahmedabad) and gradually expanding it.

#### How:

The product is ecommerce website which will required the front-end and back-end. The Java Spring framework is used to effectively build the website. [further technical specifications TBD]
